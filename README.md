Genome assembly sequence and GFF/GTF file analyzer

## Overview
GeneScoPy is a python based standalone graphical user interface (GUI) tool for working with genome assembly sequence files (FASTA) and genome annotation files (GTF/GFF). It provides a platform for:

- Inspecting and managing genome assembly files.
- Viewing genome annotation details.
- Performing basic analyses such as computing assembly statistics (e.g., N50, GC content, scaffold sizes).
- Searching and navigating annotation files efficiently.
- Higlight the region of interest in the FASTA sequence (selection based).
## Key Features
- **File Compatibility**: Supports FASTA and GTF/GFF file formats.
- **Assembly Details**: Displays total assembly length, scaffold counts, largest and smallest scaffolds, N50, and GC content.
- **Annotation Table**: Presents GTF/GFF data in an easy-to-navigate table with fields like scaffold, source, feature, start and end positions, strand, frame, product, and gene name.
- **Sequence Viewer**: Allows users to view scaffold sequences in a text editor.
- **Search Functionality**: Provides tools for searching and navigating annotation records by keywords.
- **Highlight Functionality** Highlights the sequence region of interest based annotation selection.
- **Highlight & Export Functionality**: Highlights sequence regions based on annotation selection and allows export of:
  - Selected annotation rows (`.csv`)
  - Full scaffold sequences (`.fasta`)
  - Highlighted region sequences (`.fasta`)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with a modern and intuitive GUI.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamakshSingh99/GeneScoPy/
   cd GeneScoPy
   ```
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher).
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
4. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python ./Script/Script.py
   ```

## How to Use
### Opening Files
1. Launch the application.
2. Use the `File` menu to open a FASTA file or GTF/GFF file.

### Viewing Assembly Details
- After loading a FASTA file, the "Assembly Details" section will display information about:
  - Total assembly length.
  - Number of scaffolds.
  - Largest and smallest scaffolds.
  - N50 value.

### Viewing Annotation Data
- Load a GTF/GFF file to populate the annotation table.
- Use the table columns to explore scaffold details, gene annotations, and other metadata.

### Searching Annotations
- Use the search bar to find specific entries in the annotation table.
- Navigate through results using the `Previous` and `Next` buttons.
- Check the sequence box to find the highlighted regions for selection.
- Reset the search to view the entire table again.

### Exporting Features

GeneScoPy allows exporting genome data in multiple formats directly from the GUI:

- âœ… **Export Selected Annotation Row**: Save a selected gene/feature row as a `.csv` file.
- âœ… **Export Full Scaffold**: Save the entire FASTA sequence of any scaffold in `.fasta` format.
- âœ… **Export Highlighted Region**: After selecting a gene/feature in the annotation table, export the matching sequence region as `.fasta`.

To use these:
1. Load both a FASTA and a GTF/GFF file.
2. Navigate to the `Export` menu in the menu bar.
3. Choose the appropriate export function.

## File Management
- Scaffold sequences can be selected from the list and displayed in the sequence viewer for detailed inspection.
